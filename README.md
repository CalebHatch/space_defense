# Overview

I wanted to learn more about how video games are made in Java. I also wanted to expand my knowledge of JavaFX.

Space Defense is a game in which you shoot drones coming towards you to defend the galaxy! Use the A and D keys to rotate left and right respectively. Use the spacebar to shoot.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ as my IDE to make this software.

This program was made in Java and used JavaFX.

# Useful Websites

I found these website useful while making my project.
* [Oracle Docs][(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Rectangle.html#intersects-java.awt.Rectangle-)]

# Future Work

Things to fix and add in the future
* Item 1 - Add a difficulty setting
* Item 2 - Allow the player to move along the x axis
* Item 3 - Add animations for when drones are destroyed
